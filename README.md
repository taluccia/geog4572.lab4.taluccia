For Lab 4, I generated a bubble chart. The chart is based on vegetation resource inventory data and is depicting the dominant canopy tree species and percentage of that species for a given area. 

The landscape area of interest was based on a fire perimeter. The bubble chart shows that Lodgepole pine (LP) is the dominant canopy species occupying much of the landscape. White Spruce Hybrid (SX) is another dominant species on the landscape to to a much less extent compared to Lodgepole pine. Aspen (AT) is also dominant species on the landscape, but Apsen occupies a very small portion of the landscape.

I applied the color scheme...
